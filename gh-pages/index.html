  		<p id="text">It Takes A Village is created for parents who are currently suffering from postpartum depression. By allowing parents to build a village using resources awarded for positive real-life behaviors, the game not only provides daily entertainment, but also incorporates well-researched therapy techniques (i.e. behaviorial training, cognitive restructuring, and problem solving) that aim to alleviate symptoms of postpartum depression. </p>

  		<p id="subheading">Purpose</p>
  		<p id="text">Postpartum depression is a specific type of depression that affects new parents, either after delivery or even after adopting, and can occur in both genders. It stems primarily from "postpartum baby blues," which is a brief period of mood swings, anxiety or difficulty sleeping that affect 80% of women.</p>

  		<p id="text">If symptoms of postpartum baby blues worsen, symptoms of postpartum depression may develop. Parents may have difficulty bonding with their child, begin to withdraw from their family and friends, have reduced interest in activities that were once enjoyable, or have thoughts of harming their child or themselves.</p>

  		<p id="text">When left untreated, post-partum depression may last for many months. Poor caregiving in a child's formative years can have long-lasting negative implications.</p>
